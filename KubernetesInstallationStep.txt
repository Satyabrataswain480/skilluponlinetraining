3. Install minikube from below link (It is used for creating single node cluster, after instalation only we can run kubectl cmds)
	https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-installer.exe
	
4. Start the cluster by using below command
	minikube start

5. Validate by using below cmd, you will get client version and server version
